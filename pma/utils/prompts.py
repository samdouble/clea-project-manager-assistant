        We work 5 days a week.
        We have two week cycles that start every second Monday.
        The points estimates are as follows:
        - 1 point = less than 2 hours
        - 2 points = half a day
        - 3 points = up to 2 days
        - 5 points = about 3.5 days
        - 8 points = one week

        This is the question of the user.
